### Overview

[Barchart](https://www.barchart.com) offers streaming market data for a wide range of asset classes which trade on exchanges around the world. Review our [market data catalog](https://www.barchart.com/solutions/data/market) for details.

* A WebSocket connection is established between your application and Barchart's quote servers, then
* Your application requests market data for one or more symbols, then
* Your application receives a market data stream for subscribed symbols.
