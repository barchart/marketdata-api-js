### Overview

[Barchart](https://www.barchart.com) offers streaming market data for a wide range of asset classes which trade on exchanges around the world. Review our [market data catalog](https://www.barchart.com/solutions/data/market) for details.

**This SDK enables your applications to consume real-time market data**, as follows:

* A WebSocket connection is established between your application and Barchart's quote servers, then
* Your application requests market data for one or more symbols, then
* Your application receives a market data stream for subscribed symbols.

### Openfeed

This library receives market data using a proprietary protocol called DDF. For new development, Barchart has switched to an open-source protocol called [Openfeed](https://docs.barchart.com/openfeed/#/) to transfer market data. Consequently, this library will be marked as deprecated in the near future. You can access new SDK libraries for Openfeed [here](https://www.barchart.com/solutions/services/stream).
